            <p> Did you know? When you are looking at a far away star, you are actually looking in the past. That star
                maybe has already died.
                <br>
                <br>
                When you go outside at night and gaze upon the sky, it seems eternal and unchanging. But that’s our own
                human limitation coloring our minds. We live on a much shorter time scale than the stars. But we’ve
                studied them, learned about them, and now have a great deal of understanding of them. Stars are much
                like us, in fact: They are born, they live for an amount of time, and they die. Some fade away, some
                explode, but in the end, like us, they are mortal.
                That’s a modern realization. And it’s spawned a modern fable, too, which I have seen here and there,
                usually propagated through social media.
                <br>
                Told as a morality tale, to give us a sense of perspective, it states this:
                When looking at stars, you’re actually looking into the past. Many of the stars we see at night have
                already died.
